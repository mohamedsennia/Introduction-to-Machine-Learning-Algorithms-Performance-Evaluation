In this Project, the aim is to gain an initial understanding of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will evaluate their performance using the following metrics:
Confusion Matrix
Recall
Precision
False Positive Rate
Specificity
ROC Curve
These metrics will be applied to the task of classifying handwritten digits.
this project was made in colaboration with : LABCHRI Amayas,KOULAL Yidhir Aghiles and BAROUD Yasmine
